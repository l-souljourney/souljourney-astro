I'm L-SoulJourney (执笔忠程), a lifelong learner on a journey of continuous reflection, documentation, and sharing.

**Embrace life, never back down!** This is not just my life motto, but also my resilient belief in facing investment markets, business challenges, and life's ups and downs.

In this thought garden, I share insights from my investment journey, explorations in the AI era, philosophical thoughts on business, and deep reflections on life in middle age.

All articles are also published on WeChat Official Account. Welcome to grow together with me and move forward on the path of thinking!
